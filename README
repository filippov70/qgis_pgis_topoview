Simple script to generate a QGis project for a PostGIS topology.

Requirements
------------

 - A posix shell for creating the project file.
 - QGis >= 1.7.0 with fix for bug #3845 for loading the project file.
   See https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3845
 - Oh, well... PostGIS 2.0.0 for creating a topology.

Usage
-----

Create a project for topology named "mytopo":

 $ ./qgis_pgis_topoview.sh mytopo

Add PGDATABASE env variable if different from your username:

 $  PGDATABASE=mydb ./qgis_pgis_topoview.sh mytopo

Add -x switch if you also want to start qgis:

 $ PGDATABASE=mydb ./qgis_pgis_topoview.sh -x mytopo

The created project file will be created in the present working directory
and named after the parameters. For the example above:

 topoview_mydb_mytopo.qgs

If the file already exist you'll be asked if you want to override it.
You can still open the file w/out overriding the existing one (maybe 
because you tweaked it slightly).
